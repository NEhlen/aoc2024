# Day 15

A playable version of Day 15 Part B can be started by running day_15_game.py  
Make sure the play parameter at the beginning of the script is set to True. If it's set to False, the "game" will be played automatically
by the instructions in the input file.  
If you want to "record" your game, set save_imgs to True. It will save each frame in the frames subfolder. This is not optimized, so it will quickly rack up disk space!
